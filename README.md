# Vehicle-Co2-emission
A Machine learning model deployed using FastApi for the project ecoeducation. I developed an Xgboost regression model that achieved 99.5% accuracy after extensive experimentation. Achieving this required advanced data preprocessing techniques such as data transformation, scaling, and feature engineering to enhance model performance.
